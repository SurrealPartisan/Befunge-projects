"v"40ztp1.@
    2
    .    The instruction pointer gets split in two.
         Then the original changes its clone's path.
         Both print a number to signal that the code
         works. The redirection method might be useful
         in more complex concurrent programs, too.


         The above of course works, but later I realized
         a simpler way to achieve this:

    >#vt3.@
      4
      .
      @

         ...should have been obvious.
